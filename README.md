# Motion-Detection-Estimation--Optical-Flow-using-Python
Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene.
Optical flow, or motion estimation, is a fundamental method of calculating the motion of image intensities, which may be ascribed to the motion of objects in the scene.Optical-flow methods are based on computing estimates of the motion of the image intensities over time in a video
# What is optical flow in object tracking?
Optical flow is one of the efficient approaches to track the movement of objects. Optical flow studies the relative motion of objects across different frame sequences based on the velocity of movement of objects and illumination changes.

before running the code make sure you have imported the right library and frameworks
and also i used a video of people and object moving so that the program can track each movemet in the video and drawe a path of each movements in color
any suggestion or comment let me know.and i found this very helpfull for my project. have fun.
